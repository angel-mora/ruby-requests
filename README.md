# Zego/Mobile Doorman - Homework Assignment

## Built with

- Ruby 3.0.0
- Gemfile (HTTParty, RSpec for tests and webmock for stubs requests)
- GitHub Actions

## How to use

If you want to verify everything is up and running properly, just run tests with:

```
rspec
```

There are still some potential upcoming tests but due to time limit, you can find five basic tests.

Execute the script with:

```
ruby bin/main.rb
```

This project is expected to deliver a JSON file which you can find in the repo's root path.
